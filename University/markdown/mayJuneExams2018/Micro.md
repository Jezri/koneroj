# Budget constraint.

* The budget set is also all affordable bundles.
* The line is called the budget line.
* the slope of the line is -p1/p2 this represent oppertunity cost.
* A composite goods stands for all other goods. other than good 1 a composite good is measured in dollors to be spent on other goods rather than on quantity. 
* Talk about the line getting steeper or flater
The budegt constraint is the set of all affordable budnles. not all just affordable bundles.

* Quantity tax means tax perunit quanty p1' = p1 + t
* Value tax p1' = (1+t)p1
# Numererie
Essentialy we can reduce one of the veriables to 1 by eiding by it and so simplfy the budget eqution. the veriable we do this for is called the numererie
* further if you are measuring any good in terms of the amount of moey spent on it the prce is one.

Future price of a bundle over current price of 
# Axioms of ordering??  
indiference is written ~
From the  thee axioms the indifference curves can never cross

* **Completness** at least one of the staments 
   + a is weakly prefered to a 
   + b is weakly prefered to a is true
* **reflexivity** + a is weakly prefered to a
* **Transitivity**

# Well behaved preferences/indifference curves
 
* We are only dealing with goods/ monotonacity This eans a negative slope


* Averages are prefered to extreems. Any wiehghted average of two points on the indiference curve is atleast as prefered as the original points this means convexity
$tx_1 + (1-t)y_1, tx_2 + 1-ty2 >= (x1,x2)$

# Utility function


a is weakly preffered to b imples u(a) \leq u(b)

* Budget constraint is definitly all bundles less than or equel to income.
# Different types of curves. 

## Budget lines and indefference curves

# Quasi linear 
The problem with the bottom reajoin is that it yeilds a negative consumption of one of the goods the finction should infact be given peicewise
### Deriving the mrs

* The mrs is defined as the slop of the indiference curve \frac{\Delta y}\frac{\Delta X}

**CHECK What a numerairi is assume it is just the good on the x axis**
* $\nabla{U}\cdot {\partial{y} \patial{x} = \detla U = 0}$
Mux over MUy is not the slope of the indifference curve
* $MRS = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{px}{py}= - \frac{MUx}{MUy}$

# Giffen goods vs ordinary goods. Inferrior goods vs normal goods

# Income offer curves.
Are straight lines for all homothetic preferences. substitutes complements and cobb douglas
Are drawn with good x and good y as axis
Quasi Linear
Goes straight along one axis and then straight up.

# Engle curves
Engle curves for perfect substuts are straight lines either vertical or sloped.
Engl curve for complements are sloped
Are income on the y axis and quanity demanded of good x on the x axis
Is j shaped but with striaght linnes

# Price offer curve
Are drawn with good y vs good x.
Are caled price consumption curves
Is exactly the same as the income offer curve for perfect complements
# Choice

Tangency is a sufficient condition for convex preferences
Optimal choice is called the dema_nded bundle

## Income offer curve.
This is drawn on the good x good y plane by connnecting bundles
Income expansion path

## Engle curve
Plot income against consumption of good x
## Demand curve 

## Inverse demand function
If the price of good two is set to zero the inverse demand function is set whos the mrs
## Income offer curve.
Plots income vs consumption of good x 

## Demand curve.

Cobb Douglaz
$x_1 = \frac{c}{c+d}\frac{m}{p1}$
$x_2 = \frac{d}{c+d}\frac{m}{p2}$

The consumer always spends a fixed propetion of thier income on each good. So the form $x^{a-1}y^a$ give the proportion easily

## Price consumption curve
 Curve drawn on a plot of good x against good y. by connecting points of tangency related to differnt prices of good x.


# Imperfect complements and supplements.
If the quantity of good 2 changes with the price of goood one the two are imperfect comlements or supplements
# Complements
 
# Suplements

# inferior Goods

income effect is negative

# giffen goods
income effect is negative and greater in magnitude than positive substitution effect


# Slutsky and hiksian breakdown of the income effect and other effect. 

## Hiscksian 

* Pivot the budget line around the original bundle
  + M = px' x +py' y. The old bundle is just affordable on the pivoted line.
  + Find x' and y' assosiated with the new budget line.
  +x - x' = substitution effect | x = solution(dy){dx}
* The difference between this and the original bundle will be the subituuitin effect
  + This is the substitution effect
* Move the curve backwards
* This difference will be the income effect.

## Stultskian

* First move the curve backwards to the point where the new bundle is just affordable.
* This is the income effect than pivot it this is the budget effect.

#Revealed preferences

## Strong axiom

If bundle a is directly or indirectly prefered to b than bundle b is never directly or nidirectly prefered to a

## Week axiom

If bundle a is directly prefered to b than bundle b is never directly prefered to a.

# Consumtion over time

## Quantity Indexes

$I_q = \frac{w \cdot x^t}{w \cdot x^b}$ If I_q is greater than 1 than average consumption has increased

If w is base year prices we have the laspeyres index 

If w is current prices we have the paasche index

If either the paasche is greater than 1 multiplying out yeilds. 
$p_t \cdot x^t > pt \cdot x^b$
hence the old bundle could be afforded but the new bundle was chosen

If the laspeyres index is less than 1

$pb \cdot x^t < pb \cdot x^b$ so the consumer is worse of assuming preferneces have not changed
