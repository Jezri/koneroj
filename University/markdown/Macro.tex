\begin{description}
\item[GDP(Gross Domestic product)]
The Total amount of goods and services produced within an economy in a
given year {[}\^{}mn{]} \{-\}There are three ways of culculating this *
Expenditure This must only include expenditure on goods and services
produced within the economy (no imports, and no goods produced in a
previous year) * Income This must only use income obtained by selling
goods and services (no transfer payments) * Output
\end{description}

\hypertarget{gdp-composition}{%
\section{GDP composition}\label{gdp-composition}}

To measure the GDP\footnote{GDP and total demand(Z) are used
  interchangably} it is simplest to measure the amount spent on goods
and services and then subtract the part of that which is spent on goods
and services produced outside the economy (imports) or before the given
year (invetories). Finaly goods not bought in the bought elsewhere
(exports) or stored for the future are added.\footnote{Exports and
  inventories are ignored in the begining part of the course}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consumption(C): The goods and services purchased by consumers
\item
  Investment(I): The sum of

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    no-resedential investment: Capital equipment and land bought by
    firms
  \item
    resedntial investment: Housing bought by consumers
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Goverment spending(G): The amount the goverment spendings buying goods
  and services from firms and employing workers. (goverment tranfers are
  not payments for work done and are not included)
\item
  Net exports (X-I): The total amount of exports minus imports.
\item
  Net inventory build up
\end{itemize}

This brings us to the equation \(Z = C + I + G\)

\end{itemize}

GDP is concerned with the amount of production that takes place in a
country GNP is by national citizen

GDP + income from foriegn source - production from foriegn sources

Output(Value add) = Output(Income) + assume not corporate profit is
retained.

Output(Value added) = output(expenditure) + No inventories

Output(expenditure = output(income) + No saving

A paradox is a seemingly ontradictory stament that may none the less be
true on a deaper level of meaning or understanding.

A household try to save more their income decreases by a level such that
thier income remains unsaved.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I = S + (T-G)
\item
  I = 1 - c\_0 + (1 - c\_1)Y\_n +(t\_0 + t\_1Y) -G{]}
\item
  assume autonomous savings decreases.
\item
  Draw the graph of the consumption and savings function.
\item
  People tend to spend more than they save.
\item
  Saving functions is flatter than consumtion function
\item
  More savings meens consumption function moves down and savings
  function moves up.
\item
  Change in equilibrium
\item
  So lower income meens less saved even though thier is a higher savings
  rate.
\item
  This is not indefinate the susesiive falls get smaller and smaller.
\item
  If saving and income induced tax revenues shrink.
\item
  Invesment is assumed to be constant. Savings levels will eventually
  equalize.
\item
  In reality output and investment move together.
\item
  Investment is the engine of growth in fast growign economies.

Goverment cannot change goverment spendign at its own will Medium term
expenditure plan in south africa is the 3 year plan which the goverment
must stick there are also palamentry adjsutments. Large deficits
increase risk which adversly effect exchae rate.

Anticipations are likly to matter, permanent or tempory decrease in
taxes have different effects. Full employment plus stimulation will
could result in inflation. Expansionary fiscal policy may have short run
beneficail effects. Which increase the amount of interest that needs to
be paid.

large defficits can crowd out private investment.

Is it not posible for trusted goverments to get very low interest rate
loans such that interest may even dip below infaltion?

Change in inventories are cuased by a lack of equilibrium

In cahptr 5 we will include finacial markets and in 7 we will include
the differnece between real and nominal interest. Models which show
interaction between the outpt market finacial market and labour markets

The link between the utput market and the finacial market are interest
rates and income Changes in money supply chaneg interest rates Changes
in the interest rate change the output level This again changes income.
