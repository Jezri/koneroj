# Prefrences^[chap 3]

* Consumer preference
* Indiffernce curves

Consumption bundles:

  we reprent consumtion bundles as vectors represnting the quinities of goods consumed ^[in general te first good is plotted on the x axis]

Preference relation:
  The order in which a consumer prefrence
  $a \succ b$ represent a is strictly preffered to why^[it will be chosen every time]
  
  * ~ is indefference
  * $\succ$ abouve ~ is week preference a may be strictly preffered or indifferent to y^[may mean that both are true at seperate times]

This are ordinal relations^[Cardinal actually quantiies the amount of difference not just directions]

  * Ordinal relations are transitive

  * $y \succ_~ x \wedge x \succ_~ y \to y ~ x$

[Axioms]{.smallcaps}^[Assumptions]

> * Completeness : $x < y$ or x = y or x > y$ 
> Bundles are always comparable.

> * Reflexivity any bundle x is always at least as preffered as itself
> 
> * Transitivity^[Rules out contradiction] 

## Indifferent curve
A set of bundles which are all equal preffered this is a subset to the bundles which are equal or less prefered to a givien element in the initial indifference curves.

The set of all bundles equaly prefered to x' is the indiffernce curve of x'

Charicteristic curves of indifference curves

*Can be drawn by axiom of completness
* Curves which are further from the origin represnt higher levels of utility (are more ppreffered)
  + Distants from the origin can only be in positive direction. Only goods
* Indifference curves never cross by transitivity
* Indifference curves are convex ^[We will discuss later]

Anything above to the right of x are bundles weakly preffered to x
A indifference curve is a subset of weakly prfferred bundle but not in strictly preffered bundles

indifference curves can not interesect (proof by contridiciton
transitivty more is better. 
  
second by definition

Plotting indifference curves
----------------------------

Goods

* When more of a commoditiy is always preffered
* Indifference curves are always negativly sloped

Bads

* If less of a good is always prefferd
* If there is a good and a bad the indiffernce curve is upwards sloping 

Nuterals

* No better or worse
* If indifferent to one good inffiernce curves are verticle or horizontal. 

Perfect substiute and perfect compliments
If two commodities are viewed as equivelant and satifsy same wants they are perfect substiutes and the indifference curve is straight. Only weighted amount or of the two commodities dettermines their prefference rank order.
Slopes are constant



Compliments:
  Goods which are used jointly
  Always consumed in fixed proportion.
  
  L shaped line : unpaired goods yeild no extra utility.

# Optimal solutions

* For interior choices in an optimal bundle consumers optimize by consuming a bit of each.
* If x_1 = 0 and x_2 is equal to zero than it is a corner or boundry solution
* The indiference curve is to flat or to steep using the budget line
    + Perfect Subsitutes with different costs
    + This can be prooved MU1 = MU2
    + It does not happen in all the time with substitues.(Not perfect substitues)
    + If P_1 is less than P_2 the consumer only consumers good 1
* Kinky Solutions 
* Optimum can be found by matching tangents instead find the line all bundles are on.
