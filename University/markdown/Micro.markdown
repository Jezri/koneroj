# Prefrences^[chap 3]

* Consumer preference
* Indiffernce curves

Consumption bundles:

  we reprent consumtion bundles as vectors represnting the quinities of goods consumed ^[in general te first good is plotted on the x axis]

Preference relation:
  The order in which a consumer prefrence
  $a \succ b$ represent a is strictly preffered to why^[it will be chosen every time]
  
  * ~ is indefference
  * $\succ$ abouve ~ is week preference a may be strictly preffered or indifferent to y^[may mean that both are true at seperate times]

This are ordinal relations^[Cardinal actually quantiies the amount of difference not just directions]

  * Ordinal relations are transitive

  * $y \succ_~ x \wedge x \succ_~ y \to y ~ x$

[Axioms]{.smallcaps}^[Assumptions]

> * Completeness : $x < y$ or x = y or x > y$ 
> Bundles are always comparable.

> * Reflexivity any bundle x is always at least as preffered as itself
> 
> * Transitivity^[Rules out contradiction] 

## Indifferent curve
A set of bundles which are all equal preffered this is a subset to the bundles which are equal or less prefered to a givien element in the initial indifference curves.

The set of all bundles equaly prefered to x' is the indiffernce curve of x'

Charicteristic curves of indifference curves

*Can be drawn by axiom of completness
* Curves which are further from the origin represnt higher levels of utility (are more ppreffered)
  + Distants from the origin can only be in positive direction. Only goods
* Indifference curves never cross by transitivity
* Indifference curves are convex ^[We will discuss later]

Anything above to the right of x are bundles weakly preffered to x
A indifference curve is a subset of weakly prfferred bundle but not in strictly preffered bundles

indifference curves can not interesect (proof by contridiciton
transitivty more is better. 
  
second by definition

Plotting indifference curves
----------------------------

Goods

* When more of a commoditiy is always preffered
* Indifference curves are always negativly sloped

Bads

* If less of a good is always prefferd
* If there is a good and a bad the indiffernce curve is upwards sloping 

Nuterals

* No better or worse
* If indifferent to one good inffiernce curves are verticle or horizontal. 

Perfect substiute and perfect compliments
If two commodities are viewed as equivelant and satifsy same wants they are perfect substiutes and the indifference curve is straight. Only weighted amount or of the two commodities dettermines their prefference rank order.
Slopes are constant



Compliments:
  Goods which are used jointly
  Always consumed in fixed proportion.
  
  L shaped line : unpaired goods yeild no extra utility.

# Optimal solutions

* For interior choices in an optimal bundle consumers optimize by consuming a bit of each.
* If x_1 = 0 and x_2 is equal to zero than it is a corner or boundry solution
* The indiference curve is to flat or to steep using the budget line
    + Perfect Subsitutes with different costs
    + This can be prooved MU1 = MU2
    + It does not happen in all the time with substitues.(Not perfect substitues)
    + If P_1 is less than P_2 the consumer only consumers good 1
* Kinky Solutions 
* Optimum can be found by matching tangents instead find the line all bundles are on.


## Cross price effect

First derive the direct deamnd then rearrange it

For cobb douglas there are no cros price effect.
Reduces demand for commodity 1 then commodity 1 is a gross complement for commodity 2.

For perfect compliments the partial derivate of $x_1/p_2 <0$

For perfect 1 for 1 substitues 

Own price elasticy of demand and cross price elasticty
$\frac{p_i}{x_i} \frac{p_1}{d_x}{d_p}$

Cross price elasticity

$\frac{p_i}{x_j} \frac{d_x}{d_p}$

Odenary good own price elastity is <=0
Giffen good > 0

Substitues and complements
Substitues >0
Complements $< 0$

Demand function normally consist of all goods and prices.

Be able to caculate the demand function and increased demand. 

If income increase than the budget line is going to shift outwards in a parallel manner.

Use this to derive engel curve and demand per income.

Labal every single quantity of each good for test

Income offer curve or income expanding path is on a graph with goods x1 and x2 on the axis.

Engle good is income vs quantity demand
normal goods have a positivly sloped engel curve

An inferior good is one that when one becomes richer one consumes less of.

No good is inferior at all income levels all goods are normal at very low income levels.

You cannot have both goods being inferior

How do we use ordenary demand to calculate engle curve.
    Solve for income.
    
    for complements curves are stright and upward sloping

    Perfect substitutes we know the utility function.
    x_2(p_1, p_2, m) = {0, if p_1 < p_2 \\ m/p \
    Verticle line for engle curve in a.

## Cobb douglas function. 

How do we derive the engle curve. Isolate 

* Demand is a linear function of m.
* The change in demand is propotionate to th change in income.
*

# Homotheticity

* A consumers preferences are homothetic iff the depend on the ratio of good
* (x1, x_2) \leq (y_1,y_2) \iff (kx_1 k_2) \leq (k_y1, k_y_2)
* The marginal rate of substitution is the same on all points of a line drawn straight from the origin.
* If preferences are homothetic preferences are 
* Douglas preferences. 
* So the ratio of goods consumed so it is simple to calculate levels o good at all income levels

## Quasi linear preferences. Good is a neceity with perfectly inelastic demand.

A very poor consumer can only afford good1 as you're income increase you can start to increase the amount of the necesity you consume.
As income continues to increase, the consumer buys the same amount 'optimium' of good 2 

Income Changes; Quasilinear utility.

# tut test.
Strict conveity impllies unique solution

Demand for a cobb-douglas good

* $U(x_1 x_2) = x_1 ^a + x_2 ^b$

* $x_1 = \frac{am}{(a+b)p_1}$

## Coner solution

Happens when the indeference curve is always steeper or flater or steeper then the indiference curve

If $MRS < -\frac{p1}{p2}$ consume only good 2
otherwise consume only good 1

# Revealed Preference

Utility can be deduced by the consumers actual choices.
Based on amount demanded at different price levels and different income levels construct or deduce their prferences

Assume gruops prefences do not change over the period of time that the data is gathered.
The preferences are strictly convex and monotonic

## Direct Preference revalation

The consumer is given a choice between 2 affordable bundles. the chosen bundle is reaveled diriectly to be preffered to the nonchosen one.

## Indirect 

Compare budgets i different budget sets.
Basiclly just applying transitivity.
This involves moving the slope of the budget line.

If we can find any right to left downward diagonals of Ds the data is irrational with two or more entries.

### Strong axiom (uses revealed preferences)

If x is revealed directly or indirectly as prefeed to y than it is never the case that y is prefered directly or indirectly compared to x.

Add all indirect preferences

# Test 2

* E
* C wierd?
* 
  + Use tangency.
  + Substitute into budget constraint
* Go over budget constraints.
* perfect complememnts.
* x1=3 x2.
* So just substitute in the ratio.
