# Vector analysis

## Gradiant^[Treat nabla exactly like a vector fot dot and cross products] $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$

$\nabla := \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1} \\ \vdots \\ \frac[\partial} {\partial x_n}$

## Divergance^[Copy definitions from book]

div f := $\nabla \cdot f$

## Curl 3 veriables

curl f := $\nabla \times f$ ^{Abuse of notation} 

### Properties
$\nabla f = (f'(x))^T$


## Scalar value function rn to R the Laplacain is 
  $\nabla \cdot \nabla f =$ the sum of the second partial derivates
  The brackets don't matter as dot product is assosiative
  If the laplacian is of f is equal to $\lambda$ of is harmonic

The gradiant is derivate becouse the paritial derivatives are linear for all partial derivaties
