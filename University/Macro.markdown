Macro Economics
===============

GDP
--------------
GDP(Gross Domestic product)

: The Total amount of goods and services produced within an economy in a given year
[^mn]
  {-}There are three ways of culculating this
      * Expenditure
	This must only include expenditure on goods and services produced within the economy (no imports, and no goods produced in a previous year)
      * Income
        This must only use income obtained by selling goods and services (no transfer payments)
      *  Output

# GDP composition
  To measure the GDP^[ GDP and total demand(Z) are used interchangably]
 it is simplest to measure the amount spent on goods and services and then subtract the part of that which is spent on goods and services produced outside the economy (imports) or before the given year (invetories). Finaly goods not bought in the bought elsewhere (exports) or stored for the future are added.^[Exports and inventories are ignored in the begining part of the course]

  * Consumption(C): The goods and services purchased by consumers
  * Investment(I): The sum of
    + no-resedential investment: Capital equipment and land bought by firms
    + resedntial investment: Housing bought by consumers
  * Goverment spending(G): The amount the goverment spendings buying goods and services from firms and employing workers. (goverment tranfers are not payments for work done and are not included)
  * Net exports (X-I): The total amount of exports minus imports.
  * Net inventory build up

This brings us to the equation
$Z = C + I + G$

## Consumption
Consumption is a function of disposable income ^[income minus taxation] ($Y_D$)
$$ C(Y_D) $$
Unemployment
-------------

Inflation
-----------

# GDP composition 2

Go over chapter 2

Net foriegn factor income.

Indirect taxes
:Sin taxes , value add tax , import taxes 

Directs taxes
: Direct on factor imput, wages profit

GDP at market price - direct taxs +(net subsidies)^[indirect taxes - subsidies]

## further adjustments
  - further transaction on household income
  - Insurance contrabutions(money is taken directly taken, south african pensions come directly from tax not from fund)
  - Unemployment funds (are in douth africa)
  - Corporaate taxes
  - Profits that could have been paid by firms that are retained by firms
  - transfer payments^[Do not confuse payments to and from unemployment and pension payments]
This results in personal income
  - taxes on interest 
This results in disposable income
: The amount of income a consumer can produce

GDP is concerned with the amount of production that takes place in a country
GNP is by national citizen

GDP + income from foriegn source - production from foriegn sources

Output(Value add) = Output(Income)
  + assume not corporate profit is retained.

Output(Value added) = output(expenditure)
  + No inventories

Output(expenditure = output(income)
  + No saving

**Important**

Nominal vs real GDP
: Nominal GDP = real GDP * current prices
 
 * Prices measured as a pecentage of the bases year

Real GDP higher than nominal GDP means increase in output^[Q: What is calculated first infaltion or gdp, Why not exponential but go over]

Unemplyment or inflation
----------------------------
Strict unemployment
: People that are activly looking for work
Broad unemplyment
: Poeple activly looking for work plus discouraged works (everybody who would like to work)

Broad is greater the strict easaly proovable

U or Ut is the number of people unemployed
u or ut is the unemployment rate

Paticipation rate 
: The the labour force over the population size. Higher participation rates tend to have higher employment rates.

## Problems with unemplyment

* GDP excludes the illigal economy and exculdes the legal economy that is not reported for tax evasion. 
* Good unemployment benefits may couses people to register as unemployed.
* Unemployemnt couses less than optimal production.

#inflation
An increase in the change of general price levels. inflation rate is the differentite of inflation.
An index may be simple or compound

CPI is used in south africa (goods consumed by a typical or average houshold)

  * Conducts infequent houshold servays every five or more year to get weightings
  * Consumer price index 
  * State SA trakes some prices monthly and others quaterly
  * Month by month inflationn a - b / a
  * monthly anual inflation rate. jan to jan ... dec to dec
  * annual = average of monthly annual

#. find the size of the labour force

GDP deflator
: Real GDP - Nominal GDP / reaGDP

GDP deflator and CPI move together most of the time but cpi moves faster from international shokes.

Competition determines how much price shocks are communicated to consumers.

Hyperinflation and deflation

Inflation affect income distrabution

* Fixed income earners such as pensioners loose income
* Distorions
* Bracket creep(Goverments try to adjust)
* Exchange and inflation tend to move together

Is inflation ever good

* In japan moderate inflation could have worked
* High deflation can lead to uncertainty
* Why does low inflation make monetary policy useless
  + Inflation and interest rate move together.
  + Centeral bank cannot reduce interest rates below zero
 

# Chapter 3

## Core assumptions
## 


# Understanding the economics of GDP equation.

## The aggregate expenditure model.
In equalibrium 

* $Y = \text{income} = \text{output}$ **45 degree line**
* $Y = C + I + G + (X-M)$
* solve for $Y$
* Alternitive leakages vs injections in the goods/output market
* Find saving (the part of disposable income which is not consumed)
  + $Yd$ is disposable income $Y -T$ ^[Taxes do not very with income for simpplity.]
* National income may be veiw as the aount of income earned or the amount generated.
* $Y= C + T + S$
* Generation 
  + Generated by private investment goverment of and private spending.
  + Or factor income.
* Equat the right hand side of both equations and solve for S
* Group together goverment policy
 + Assume govermant defiicit
 + $S= \text{private savings} \text{corperate saveings}$
 + Some private savings are used to finaces deficit so there is crowding out of privated investment.
 + Solve for I to show this 
 + If goverment is running a surplus goverment has savings which is used to finace private sector investment.
 + $S_p + S_g = I$
 + Than add G on both sides of the inequality.
 + LHS saving and taxes are lelakages
* In equilibrium leakages are equal to injections


Diagamatically

* Draw a line represnting the realtionship between I + G and S + T
* replace S by a function of income. 
* S + T veries positivly with Y and S +T0 is negative.
* Leakages are equel to investment when the two lines meet

## Introducing imports and exports

* Exports are a leakage. Impports are an injection
* Solve for S with exports and imports
* group G and T
* group X and M
* Interprete the equation
  + assume that G > T and X > M
  + curret and finacial acount
  + Blance of payment meens imports must be equal to 0
  + Balance of payments := current acount + finacial account
  + Part of our saving are being held off shore.
  + $F_s$ is domestic savings held offshore.
  + Solve for I in an open economy
  + South African rand is volatile becouse of high reaince on short term forign loans.

* Methedology used to find equilibrium dependece on veriables given

# Paradox of thrift

A paradox is a seemingly ontradictory stament that may none the less be true on a deaper level of meaning or understanding.

A household try to save more their income decreases by a level such that thier income remains unsaved. 

* I = S + (T-G)
* I = 1 - c_0 + (1 - c_1)Y_n +(t_0 + t_1Y) -G]
* assume autonomous savings decreases.
* Draw the graph of the consumption and savings function.
* People tend to spend more than they save.
* Saving functions is flatter than consumtion function
* More savings meens consumption function moves down and savings function moves up.
* Change in equilibrium
* So lower income meens less saved even though thier is a higher savings rate.
* This is not indefinate the susesiive falls get smaller and smaller.
* If saving and income induced tax revenues shrink.
* Invesment is assumed to be constant. Savings levels will eventually equalize.
* In reality output and investment move together.
* Investment is the engine of growth in fast growign economies.

# Is the goverement omnipontent

Goverment cannot change goverment spendign at its own will
Medium term expenditure plan in south africa is the 3 year plan which the goverment must stick there are also palamentry adjsutments.
Large deficits increase risk which adversly effect exchae rate.

Anticipations are likly to matter, permanent or tempory decrease in taxes have different effects.
Full employment plus stimulation will could result in inflation. 
Expansionary fiscal policy may have short run beneficail effects. Which increase the amount of interest that needs to be paid.

large defficits can crowd out private investment.

Is it not posible for trusted goverments to get very low interest rate loans such that interest may even dip below infaltion?

Change in inventories are cuased by a lack of equilibrium

In cahptr 5 we will include finacial markets and in 7 we will include the differnece between real and nominal interest.
Models which show interaction between the outpt market finacial market and labour markets

The link between the utput market and the finacial market are interest rates and income
Changes in money supply chaneg interest rates
Changes in the interest rate change the output level
This again changes income. 

# The mathamatical model of the finacial market.
## Functions of money
## Motives fror holding money
## nessesary information

* Assume their are only two markets
  - Exclude stock market
  - Exclude Diravite market
  -W is finacial wealth total amount owed + total amount of bonds ownd
  - Cu is currency held by public
  - D is the deposits in private /or commercial banks
  - Using simple balance sheets (Aggregated all balance sheets for commercial banks)
  - Liability are accounts held by consumers
  - Assets are goverment bnods(assume short term goverment bond with a one year period)
  - Bonds are bought from goverment
  - Bonds are an interest yielding good
  - Bond are fixed interst rate
  - Goverment issues bonds to the private sector and to the central bank

      Assets  Liabi
----- ------- ---------      

Required reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to assets that may be issued based on the amounts of bonds. Not on loans. Money is created in the baking sector though loans and lent out through. 

Look at differen measures of money supply in south africa. Assume money earns no interest.
Assume all acounts are cheque account deposits rather than saving accounts IE low interest rates.

## The inverse relationship between interest rates and the price of bonds. Zero coupon bonds. face value is determined by the issuer or goverment. This is the result that the goverment borrows from consumer

* Assume there is an expectation that interest rates will increase in the future. Assume individuals want to hold more money
* Total wealth is money + bonds
* holding more money meens selling bonds
* Increase in the supply of bonds.
* So price of bonds increases 
* Ask about this it is confusing.
* To see the effect of interest rate expecations 
*
* Money Demand = currency demand by the private sector + Deposites
* $\frac{C_u}{D} = c$ so curreny is a proportion of money demanded?
* derive the ration between Md and Dd = 1-c
* h donnates central bank money = currency + deposites with central bank (held by private banks)
* GO OVER FULL EQUATIONS FOR MONEY SUPPLY.
